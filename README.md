# Multi-Robot Solar Farm Simulation

This project is an interactive simulation of a multi-robot solar farm environment. The robots can move around a grid, collect resources, and build solar panels. The environment includes obstacles, resources, and solar panels that generate electricity with adjacency bonuses.

# Features
- Multi-Robot Environment**: Multiple robots can move, collect resources, and build solar panels.
- Solar Panel Synergy**: Panels generate bonus electricity if adjacent to other panels.
- Interactive Pygame Interface**: Play or edit the grid in real-time.
- Random Agent**: A placeholder agent that takes random actions for demonstration purposes.
